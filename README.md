# Quantum-Simulation-of-Two-Qubit-Hamiltonian-Dynamics-Using-the-Jordan-Wigner-Transformation
This project focuses on simulating the dynamics of a two-qubit quantum system using QuTiP, a quantum computing library in Python. The core objective is to implement and explore a simplified quantum simulation framework that encodes a Hamiltonian using the Jordan-Wigner transformation,
